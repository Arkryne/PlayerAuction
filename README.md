# PlayerAuction
IPL Player Auction using Tkinter Frames and SQLite3 for database management

Simple application. Execute in terminal. The teams are stored as an attribute in the PLAYER table, and need to be wiped on closing the app.
Delete the player table in the terminal before re-execution for this reason.

Perform the Auction first. After exiting it, the roster of each team can be viewed in 'View Teams'.
